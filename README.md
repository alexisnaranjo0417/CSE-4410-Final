The inspiration behind my game were a variety of 2D platformers such as Jump King and Super Mario while also getting some inspirtation from bouldering for the naming of the levels. The main goal of the game is to reach the top of the level and touch the flag pole while avoiding falling off to beat the level while collecting as many coins as you can. There are four levels in this version of the game and after beating all four levels you beat the game. The game is a simple 2D platformer that only has running and jumping to go through the game. As the player goes from level to level the game will get harder with each one with some platforms being wider and stationary to others being smaller and moving. The lose condition of this game is that when you fall off the platforms you will be reset to the start of the level you were on and additionally if the player has coins they will lose one coin.
